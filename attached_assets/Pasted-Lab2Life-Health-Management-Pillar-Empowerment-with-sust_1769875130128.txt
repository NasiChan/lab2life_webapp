Lab2Life — Health Management

Pillar: Empowerment (with sustainability-friendly habits as a bonus)

Lab2Life turns confusing bloodwork and medical documents into a simple, personalized action plan. Users upload lab results, and the app extracts key vitamin and nutrient metrics, then suggests safe next steps: supplements, food choices, and lightweight physical wellness habits—plus scheduling and interaction checks to reduce risk.
