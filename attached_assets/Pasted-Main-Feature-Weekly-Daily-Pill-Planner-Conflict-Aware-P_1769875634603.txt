Main Feature: Weekly + Daily Pill Planner (Conflict-Aware)
Pill Timeline (Daily View)

A simple timeline that shows exactly what to take and when:

Morning

Midday

Evening

Bedtime

Each pill card shows:

Name + dose

“With food / Empty stomach” tag

“Must be separated from ___” tag (if any)

One-line “why” explanation

Taken / Snooze buttons

Weekly Schedule (Weekly View)

A calendar-style grid showing:

Days of the week across the top

Time blocks down the side (Morning / Midday / Evening / Bedtime)

Pills placed into blocks (tap for details)

This helps users:

Spot missed doses

See patterns (“I always forget the afternoon one”)

Plan ahead (travel, busy days)

Conflict Prevention + “Allowed Together” Groups
Conflict-Aware Scheduling

When the user adds a new pill (med or supplement), Lab2Life checks:

Known conflicts (separate)

Preferred pairs (okay together)

Food rules (with food vs empty stomach)

User prescription timing (never override)

Then it either:

Auto-schedules it into the best time block, or

Prompts: “This should be taken 2 hours apart from Calcium. Pick a time.”

Together vs Separate rules (simple UX)

Use clear labels:

✅ Safe together

⏱️ Separate by 2 hours

⚠️ Avoid together (strong warning + explanation)

Example of “meant to be taken together”

Sometimes combinations are intentional (ex: certain supplements taken with meals, or multi-vitamins).
So your app should support:

Stacks (Pill Groups)

A “stack” is a set of pills taken at the same time:

Morning Stack: Vitamin D + Omega-3 (with food)

Evening Stack: Magnesium (bedtime)

Users can create stacks manually, and the app can suggest them when safe.

What happens when there’s a conflict (best UX flow)

When the user tries to schedule something that conflicts:

Popup:
“Potential conflict detected”

Iron should be separated from calcium by ~2 hours because calcium can reduce iron absorption.
Options:

Auto-fix schedule

Let me choose times

I’m taking these together on purpose (requires confirming + shows caution)

This last option is exactly your “unless meant to be taken together” requirement.

Data model idea (simple, but powerful)

Each “pill item” has:

name

type: medication | supplement

dose

frequency: daily / specific days / x times per day

timeBlock: morning/midday/evening/bedtime or exact time

foodRule: with_food | empty_stomach | either

separationRules: list of { otherPill, minutesApart, reason }

allowedTogetherWith: list of pill names (optional)

userOverride: true/false

This makes your “conflict-aware weekly planner” actually implementable.

Super short write-up you can paste in your feature list

Weekly/Daily Pill Planner:
“Lab2Life provides a daily timeline and weekly calendar view of all medications and supplements. It auto-schedules vitamins into optimal time blocks (with/without food) and prevents conflicts by warning users and spacing doses—while allowing intentional ‘stack’ groups when pills are safe or meant to be taken togethe
